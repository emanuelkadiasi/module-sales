1- The problem with limit is that you are not able to set it dinamiclly on query you can set it only static if you set it static will not be able to see all the product

2- In my opinion i will set limit after query collection with "setPageSize" "setCurPage"

3- i have set limit and offset to work correnct in this way "$subject->setPageSize($subject->getPageSize());" and "$subject->setCurPage($subject->getCurPage());"

4- All work correct write not

I am not a software engineer but i try to give a solution as i understand the exercise.

Thank you
